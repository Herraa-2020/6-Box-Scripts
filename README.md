# 6-Box-Scripts


Scripts for 6-boxing

For these scripts to work you need to make sure you have the following addons for FFXI

(SEND) (SENDALLTARGET) (GEARSWAP)

You can adjust the names in the send command in the base .txt files to fit the propper characters for your setup. You can also set up an alias to hotkey the script which is in the work for me as well and I will update that on the init.txt and update it here shortly.
